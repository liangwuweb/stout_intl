                </h4>
                <p>All users should create content that is related to UW-Stout. For example, posting information about “how to transfer to UW-Stout.” That said, posting information about “how to transfer to a college in the US” is not specific enough to UW-Stout. Non-Stout related posts will be removed by site administrator.</p>
                <p>All users are expected to identify keywords for their make posts. This keyword will guide other users’ decisions about whether to read the content or not. Posts cannot be published without keywords. After posts have been published, the keyword will appear under the title of the post.</p>
                <div class="card bg-light shadow-none">
                    <div class="card-body">
                        <p>Keywords are also created by site administrators. For instance, an administrator identifies “study” as a keyword. Then users can choose this keyword when they write a post about this topic. </p>
